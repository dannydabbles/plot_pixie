### How to Use

Fill what you like,  
or leave a space,  
my magic will craft a matching face.  

For novices and masters, heed this rhyme,  
Follow these steps, one at a time:

1. Begin with your character's name so neat,  
   A personal touch makes the journey complete.
2. Choose a class, be it rogue or mage,  
   Each has its skills, so set your stage.
3. Adjust the fields, pick traits that fit,  
   Strength, wisdom, or charm? You commit.
4. Add equipment, potions, and gear,  
   Essentials for quests, far and near.

Remember, options can be left in a haze,  
And the system's magic will craft in its own ways.  
Review your creation, see it come alive,  
Edit, save, and share, watch your character thrive.
